# Automatically add back-references to all your Bear notes

## Why

This idea come from this [question][reddit post] on reddit.

## What 

In Bear note it's possible to have hyperlinks to other notes. 
For now in Bear there are no option to display within a note A any other note B that contains a link to A.

After you ran this script, for every such note B, you'll have a link to B within note A:

```bash
in progress
```
